ChatGPT was used to guide the code for simulating data. 


You said:
based on this data, can you do a simulated data code (R)

ChatGPT said:
I'll examine the uploaded files to understand the structure of the data and identify how I can generate simulated data using R. Let's first inspect both files to get a sense of their content.

The CSV file contains data on average prices by vendors, specifically listing the vendor names along with their most_expensive_count. Now, I'll inspect the contents of the SQLite database file to understand its structure. ​​

It looks like the SQLite database file does not contain any tables, which means there's no data to extract from it.

Given that we only have data available from the CSV file, I can proceed with generating simulated data based on the structure and values provided in that file using R. Could you clarify the specific type of simulation you'd like to perform? For example:

Simulating additional vendor data with counts.
Generating time series data related to the vendors.
Creating randomized most_expensive_count based on some distribution.
Let me know your preference, and I'll prepare the corresponding R code!

can you do a simluated tests for the same data files 

ChatGPT said:
Got it! I'll create a new R script that not only simulates data but also performs tests on the simulated data based on the structure of your original files.

Here’s the plan:

Simulate Data: I'll generate data similar to the average_prices_by_vendor.csv file.
Perform Statistical Tests: I'll include some basic tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) to analyze differences between vendor groups.
Let’s craft the R script for you!

Here's the R code that simulates data and performs statistical tests based on the structure of your provided CSV file. The goal is to simulate vendor-related data and analyze it using statistical methods like t-tests and ANOVA.

R Script: Simulating Data and Running Tests
#### Preamble ####
# Purpose: Simulate vendor-related data and perform statistical tests
# Author: Bruce Zhang
# Date: 13 November 2024
# Contact: brucejc.zhang@mail.utoronto.ca
# License: MIT

#### Workspace setup ####
library(dplyr)
library(tibble)
library(ggplot2)

#### Simulate data ####
set.seed(1113)

# Define vendors based on the sample file
vendors <- c("Metro", "Loblaws", "NoFrills", "Voila", "TandT", "Walmart", "Costco", "Sobeys", "FreshCo", "Superstore")

# Set the number of observations per vendor
num_vendors <- length(vendors)
observations_per_vendor <- 30

# Generate simulated dataset
simulated_data <- tibble(
  vendor = rep(vendors, each = observations_per_vendor),
  most_expensive_count = round(rnorm(num_vendors * observations_per_vendor, mean = 15000, sd = 5000))
)

# Display first few rows of the simulated data
print(head(simulated_data))

#### Exploratory Data Analysis ####
# Summary statistics by vendor
summary_stats <- simulated_data %>%
  group_by(vendor) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_count = mean(most_expensive_count),
    sd_count = sd(most_expensive_count),
    count = n()
  )
print(summary_stats)

# Visualize data distribution
ggplot(simulated_data, aes(x = vendor, y = most_expensive_count)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Most Expensive Counts by Vendor", y = "Count", x = "Vendor")

#### Statistical Tests ####

# One-way ANOVA to compare means between different vendors
anova_result <- aov(most_expensive_count ~ vendor, data = simulated_data)
summary(anova_result)

# Pairwise t-tests with p-value adjustment
pairwise_result <- pairwise.t.test(
  simulated_data$most_expensive_count,
  simulated_data$vendor,
  p.adjust.method = "bonferroni"
)
print(pairwise_result)

#### Save simulated data to CSV ####
write.csv(simulated_data, "simulated_vendor_data.csv", row.names = FALSE)
Explanation of the Code
Simulating Data:
Generates random data for most_expensive_count using a normal distribution centered around 15,000 with a standard deviation of 5,000.
Creates 30 observations per vendor.
Exploratory Data Analysis:
Provides summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, count) for each vendor.
Visualizes the data distribution using a boxplot.
Statistical Tests:
One-way ANOVA: Compares the means of most_expensive_count between vendors to see if there are significant differences.
Pairwise t-tests: Checks for significant differences between each pair of vendors with Bonferroni correction.
Output:
The script saves the simulated dataset to a CSV file named simulated_vendor_data.csv.
Instructions for Running the Script
Copy the code into an R script file (e.g., simulate_and_test.R).
Run the script in an R environment using source("simulate_and_test.R").
Review the statistical analysis output in your R console and check for the saved CSV file.
Let me know if you need further customization or additional analyses!
